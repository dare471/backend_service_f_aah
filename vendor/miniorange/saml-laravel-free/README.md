# What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?
**Single Sign-On** is an authorization and authentication process that enables an user to connect to multiple enterprise applications using a single set of credentials. Simply put, SSO combines multiple application login pages into just one, allowing you to submit credentials just once and gain access to all the applications without having to log in to each one individually. End users save time and effort by not having to sign into and out of a variety of on-premises, web and cloud applications on a regular basis.

SSO or single sign-on is a critical component of the Identity and Access Management or access privileges services. SSO solution perfectly implemented within an enterprise simplifies overall password management, improving productivity and security, lowering the likelihood of weak, lost, or forgotten passwords
